# celestia

While analyzing the operation and performance of my node, I first wanted to know its performance on my device. For this, I first checked how much processor and ram it was using using the "htop" command. Then I checked how much hard disk space it was using using the "df -h" command. Then I used the command "journalctl -u celestia-lightd.service -f" to see if the logs are working properly.
